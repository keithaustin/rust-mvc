# A multi-threaded webserver in Rust

This is a project I am working on to familiarize myself more with Rust, as well as to learn more about working with server-side code. I have previously worked with many MVC and MVVM frameworks and wanted to learn more about implementing my own. Currently the only real work I've done(besides reading and iterating on the official Rust documentation's chapter on building a webserver)is to begin working on a router to take request and retrieve the proper response. 

Future plans for this project include iterating further on the router(I would very much like to have some of the magic syntax something like Ruby on Rails has for creating routes), adding models(meaning interfacing with a database, most likely MongoDB), a more robust solution to serving views, and controller architecture. 

The goal is not necessarily to have a fully-featured, production-ready MVC framework, however, having something that could be feasibly be used in a small scale web application would be really great, and so far this has been a great first project in Rust.
